# AeroMesh Demo Script - 3-5 Minutes

## 🎬 Shot 1: Opening & Project Introduction (30 seconds)

**Visual**: Full screen of the 3D visualization with drones flying
**Narration**: 
> "This is AeroMesh - a Digital Twin drone swarm simulation built for the Somnia Data Streams Mini Hackathon. What you're seeing is 50 autonomous drones navigating a virtual cityscape in real-time, powered by blockchain technology."

**Actions**:
- Show the full visualization
- Point out the "AEROMESH" title at top
- Rotate camera to show different angles

---

## 🎬 Shot 2: Technical Architecture (45 seconds)

**Visual**: Keep 3D scene running, focus on HUD elements
**Narration**:
> "The system uses several cutting-edge technologies:
> - Next.js 16 with React 19 for the web interface
> - React Three Fiber for real-time 3D rendering
> - The Boids algorithm for realistic flocking behavior
> - And most importantly - Somnia Data Streams for blockchain integration"

**Actions**:
- Point to the Network Status indicator (top-left, green "SOMNIA TESTNET")
- Show TPS counter
- Point to Events counter showing activity
- Show ON-CHAIN counter incrementing

---

## 🎬 Shot 3: Live Blockchain Integration (60 seconds)

**Visual**: Open browser console (F12) while keeping scene visible
**Narration**:
> "Here's where it gets interesting. Every drone event you see is being published to the Somnia blockchain in real-time. Let me show you the actual transactions."

**Actions**:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console tab
2. Point to messages like:
   - `✅ Published to Somnia: COLLISION_AVOIDED for AGENT-05`
   - `🔗 TX Hash: 0x...`
3. Copy a transaction hash
4. Open new tab → Navigate to Somnia Explorer
5. Paste transaction hash or go to wallet address: `https://shannon-explorer.somnia.network/address/0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266?tab=txs`
6. Show transactions appearing (even if delayed)

**Narration**:
> "Each transaction contains encoded drone telemetry - collision events, battery status, network latency, and consensus data. This demonstrates how Digital Twins can leverage Somnia's high-throughput blockchain for real-time data streams."

---

## 🎬 Shot 4: Schema & Data Structure (30 seconds)

**Visual**: Show VS Code with `lib/schema.ts` open
**Narration**:
> "The data structure is defined using Somnia's schema system. Each event contains the event type, message, timestamp, drone ID, and a unique nonce."

**Actions**:
- Show the schema definition:
  ```typescript
  export const DRONE_EVENT_SCHEMA = 'string eventType, string message, uint64 timestamp, string droneId, uint256 nonce';
  ```
- Show the encoder usage in `simulation.ts`

---

## 🎬 Shot 5: Live Event Log (30 seconds)

**Visual**: Back to full screen 3D view
**Narration**:
> "Watch the activity log at the bottom. These events are generated by the autonomous drones as they navigate the city, avoid obstacles, and complete delivery missions."

**Actions**:
- Point to the bottom console showing real-time logs
- Show different event types appearing:
  - COLLISION_AVOIDED
  - PACKAGE_DELIVERED
  - BATTERY_LOW
  - NETWORK_LATENCY
  - BLOCK_SYNC

---

## 🎬 Shot 6: Interactive Controls (20 seconds)

**Visual**: Demonstrate camera controls
**Narration**:
> "The visualization is fully interactive. You can rotate, pan, and zoom to explore the drone swarm from any angle."

**Actions**:
- Left-click drag to rotate
- Right-click drag to pan
- Scroll to zoom in/out
- Show close-up of individual drones with their trails

---

## 🎬 Shot 7: System Stats (20 seconds)

**Visual**: Focus on HUD panels
**Narration**:
> "The system displays real-time metrics including:
> - Somnia Testnet connection status
> - Transactions per second
> - Total events processed
> - On-chain transactions confirmed"

**Actions**:
- Point to each stat panel
- Show them updating in real-time

---

## 🎬 Shot 8: Code Walkthrough (30 seconds)

**Visual**: Quick glance at key files in VS Code
**Narration**:
> "The codebase is clean and modular with clear separation of concerns."

**Actions**:
- Show `lib/simulation.ts` - Boids algorithm
- Show `lib/schema.ts` - Data structure
- Show `components/Scene.tsx` - 3D visualization
- Show `components/HUD.tsx` - UI layer

---

## 🎬 Shot 9: Use Cases & Vision (30 seconds)

**Visual**: Back to full 3D view with dramatic angle
**Narration**:
> "This proof-of-concept demonstrates how Digital Twins can use blockchain for:
> - Supply chain tracking with drone deliveries
> - Real-time fleet monitoring
> - Autonomous system coordination
> - Immutable audit trails for logistics
> 
> All with Somnia's high-throughput, low-latency blockchain."

---

## 🎬 Shot 10: Closing (15 seconds)

**Visual**: Zoom out to show full scene with many drones
**Narration**:
> "AeroMesh - Bringing Digital Twins to life on the Somnia blockchain. Built for the Somnia Data Streams Mini Hackathon. Thank you for watching!"

**Actions**:
- Show GitHub URL on screen: `github.com/SohamJuneja/AeroMesh`
- Fade to black

## 📝 Recording Tips

1. **Resolution**: Record at 1080p or 4K
2. **Frame Rate**: 60fps for smooth visualization
3. **Audio**: Use clear microphone, no background noise
4. **Screen**: Close unnecessary browser tabs/apps
5. **Practice**: Run through once before recording
6. **Browser Console**: Have it ready in a side-by-side view
7. **Explorer Tab**: Pre-load the wallet address page

## 🎯 Key Points to Emphasize

✅ Real blockchain integration (not mock)
✅ 50 autonomous drones with AI behavior
✅ Real-time data publishing to Somnia
✅ Schema-based data encoding
✅ Interactive 3D visualization
✅ Production-ready code architecture
✅ Practical use case for logistics/supply chain

## 🎬 Alternative: Silent Demo with Text Overlays

If you prefer not to narrate, add text overlays explaining:
1. "50 Autonomous Drones"
2. "Real-time Blockchain Publishing"
3. "Somnia Data Streams Integration"
4. "Boids Flocking Algorithm"
5. "Transaction Hash: 0x..."
6. "GitHub.com/SohamJuneja/AeroMesh"

Use video editing software to add these text overlays with smooth transitions.
